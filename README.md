An open source version of the board game Scotland Yard

Build it with:

You are always the investigators, chasing Mr. X, whose location is initially unknown. P1 (yellow) goes first.

Click on TAXI, BUS, or U (underground) and the accessible nodes will be highlighted. Click one of the highlighted nodes to move the current investigator to that node.
